# MergeQueue Demo repository
You can form or clone this repository to test out Aviator MergeQueue. The only useful component in this repository is a GitHub action: `.github/workflows/pycheck.yml` that you can use to validate the MergeQueue workflow.

## Automation scripts
We internally use a similar repository for automated testing. That means, we have also written a few scripts to auto-generate various types of PRs (merge conflict, stacked PRs, with approvals, failing CI, etc). If you are interested in using those scripts for high volume testing, please reach out to us at howto@aviator.co.
